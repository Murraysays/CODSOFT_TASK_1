TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION

## Titanic Survival Prediction Model
This data science project forecasts the Titanic passengers' chances of surviving. A free dataset from Kaggle that included passenger information about the ship's occupants was used to train and test the model. This project forecasts the survival of Titanic passengers using a Gradient Boosting Classifier. The project serves as an example of the complete machine learning pipeline, which includes feature engineering, data preprocessing, and model evaluation. The Jupyter Notebook was used to build it entirely.

## Features
- Predicts Titanic survival probabilities with high accuracy. Includes:
  - Data cleaning.
  - Exploratory data analysis.
  - Numerical encoding of categorical variables.
  - Model training using Gradient Boosting Classifier.
  - Evaluation metrics like accuracy.
